SBA 318: Express Server Application

Introduction:

Welcome to my Express Server Application! This project demonstrates my understanding of Node and Express and my capability to implement their features in a practical manner. I had the freedom to choose the topic, material, and purpose of the web application, and with that, I chose to create an application that allows users to build their Justice League team, Avengers team, and Pokemon team.

Objectives:
- Create a server application with Node and Express.
- Create a RESTful API using Express.
- Create and use custom Express middleware.
- Use a template engine to render views with Express.
- Interact with a self-made API through HTML forms.

Features:

Middleware:
- Custom middleware to log request details and another for request validation.
- Error-handling middleware to manage errors gracefully.
Data Categories:
- Three different data categories: DC characters, Marvel characters, and Pokemon.
- Structured data for easy manipulation and retrieval.
RESTful API:
- GET routes for retrieving all characters.
- POST routes for adding new characters.
- PATCH routes for updating existing characters.
- DELETE routes for removing characters.
- Query parameters for filtering data.
- Route parameters for specific data handling.
Views and Forms: 
- Use of a template engine to render views.
- Simple CSS styling for rendered views.
- Forms to add new characters to the teams.

Instructions:

I created a single-page web application with the topic and content of my choice. I followed the technical requirements listed below. I focused on finishing the minimum requirements first and then added more features and complexity as time permitted.

Requirements:
- Create and use at least two pieces of custom middleware.
- Create and use error-handling middleware.
- Use at least three different data categories (DC characters, Marvel characters, Pokemon).
- Utilize reasonable data structuring practices.
- Create GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client.
- Create POST routes for data creation.
- Create PATCH or PUT routes for data manipulation.
- Create DELETE routes for data deletion.
- Include query parameters for data filtering.
- Utilize route parameters, where appropriate.
- Adhere to REST principles.
- Create and render at least one view using a view template and template engine.
- Use simple CSS to style the rendered views.
- Include a form within a rendered view that allows interaction with the RESTful API.

Future Improvements:

Databases
- Including a database to score each user's attempt and rank them with others.

Installing/Usage:

- Clone the GitHub repository: https://github.com/saidmsajady/318.SBA-.git
- Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.

Languages:

- JavaScript: The primary language for its versatility and wide use in web development.
- Node.js/Express.js: Enables running JavaScript code outside the browser, facilitating testing and execution.
- HTML and CSS: Used for creating and styling the views.
